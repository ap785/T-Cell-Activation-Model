## Overview

The mathematical model simulates T cell activation under different conditions, considering the impact of costimulatory signals such as CD2, ICAM, CD28, CD27, and 4-1BB. The implemented models are based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the dynamics of key variables over time.

## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ap785/TCellActivationModel.git
