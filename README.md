# T Cell Activation Mathematical Model
ODE-based Mathematical Model of T cell activation following antigen stimulation over time

This repository contains a mathematical model for T cell activation, implemented in Python using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. The model explores different scenarios, including variations with and without costimulatory signals.

## Overview

The mathematical model simulates T cell activation under different conditions, considering the impact of engaging the costimulatory receptors: CD2, ICAM, CD28, CD27, and 4-1BB. The implemented models are based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the dynamics of key variables over time. The schematic below indicates at which point each costimulatory receptor integrates into the T cell signalling pathway. Note that 41BB receptor expression is induced after T cell signalling leads to initial output production. 

L: pMHC
R: TCR
C: TCR-pMHC complex
M: Intracellular signalling threshold switch

![Figure Description](model_fig.png)

Specifically the models compares the production of cytokine (ouput) over time under different costimulatory conditions (CD2, LFA-1, CD28, 41BB, CD27). There are 3 models, each for the output of 3 different cytokines: IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha. The data is plotted as the rate of production over the first 12 hours and last 8 hours to identify under which costimulation does cytokine continue to be produced at later timepoints. 

## Usage

To use the model, first run the models for each cytokine.

## Parameters

$k_{on}$: TCR-pMHC association rate ($\mu m^{2}s^{-1}$)

$k_{off}$: TCR-pMHC dissociation rate ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{syn}$: basal TCR upregulation ($s^{-1}\mu m^{-2}$)

$k_{basal}$: basal (ligand-independent) TCR down-regulation ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{down}$: ligand-induced TCR down-regulation ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{act}$: production of switch / signaling amplification ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{prod}$: cytokine production rate ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{deg}$: Degradation of switch ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{cdeg}$: Degradation of output ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{on_2}$: costimulatory receptor-ligand association rate ($\mu m^{2}s^{-1}$)

$k_{off_2}$: costimulatory receptor-ligand dissociation rate ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{syn_2}$: basal costimulatory receptor upregulation ($s^{-1}\mu m^{-2}$)

$k_{basal_2}$: basal (ligand-independent) costimulatory receptor down-regulation ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{down_2}$: ligand-induced costimulatory receptor down-regulation ($s^{-1}$)

$k_{cd2a}$: CD2 costimulation (proximal)

$k_{cd2b}$: CD2 costimulation (distal)

$k_{icama}$: LFA-1 costimulation (proximal)

$k_{icamb}$: LFA-1 costimulation (distal)

$k_{28}$: CD28 costimulation (distal)

$C_{\text{star}}$: Intracellular signalling threshold

$C_{\text{star2}}$ 4-1BB costimulation threshold

$time_{\text{delay}}$ - 41BB upregulation delay after T cell activation

## Results

1. All costimulatory receptors increased the rate of cytokine production (from total_output.py) compared to when TCR is engaged with no costimulation
2. CD2, LFA-1 & 41BB cositmulation increase the rate of productino at the later timepoint across all cytokine outputs (rate_bar_plot.py)
3. For IFN-g production the rate of cytokine production stays fairly constant under CD2 costimulation, however the production rate decreases for IL-2 nad TNF-alpha. This is due to cytokien degradation incoporated into the model for the latter cytokines.
